# 📊 NumPy Hands-On Project

## 🧠 Overview
This project is part of the **"Data Analysis and Processing: NumPy Library"** course within the **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence track**.

It aims to apply essential NumPy concepts through a series of practical tasks involving arrays, their properties, and core operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create arrays using `linspace` and reshape them.
- Explore array attributes: `dtype`, `shape`, `size`, `ndim`, `type`.
- Practice array iteration with `nditer`.
- Access and locate elements using indexing and `np.where`.
- Merge and split arrays along various axes.

---

## 🧪 Tasks Breakdown

### ✅ Array Creation
- Create a 1D float array using `linspace`.
- Create a 3D array with shape `(2, 2, 3)` containing specific values.

### 🧾 Array Properties
- Print array `type`, `dtype`, `shape`, `size`, and `ndim`.

### 🌀 Reshaping & Type Conversion
- Reshape the array to 4D.
- Convert the array to integer type.

### 🔁 Element Operations
- Iterate over all elements using `np.nditer()`.
- Access specific elements by index.
- Locate specific values using `np.where()`.

### 🔃 Reshape into New Structure
Reshape the array into the following structure:

```python
array([
    [[ 1,  2],
     [ 3,  4],
     [ 5,  6]],

    [[ 7,  8],
     [ 9, 10],
     [11, 12]]
])

🧩 Merge & Split Arrays

    Merge two arrays without specifying the axis.

    Merge two arrays along axis=1.

    Split the merged array into two arrays using axis=1.
